## Basic Usage

Beetsâ€™ tagger is invoked using the `beet import` command.

Music should be organized by album into directories. That is, the tagger assumes that each album is in a single directory. These directories can be arbitrarily deep, but any directory with music files in it is interpreted as a separate album.

Useful command line options:

- `beet import -s`: run in singleton mode, tagging individual tracks instead of whole albums at a time.

Import choices:

- **A**: Apply the suggested changes shown and move on.
- **M**: Show more options.
- **S**: Skip this album entirely and move on to the next one.
- **U**: Import the album without changing any tags.
- **T**: Import the directory as singleton tracks, not as an album.
- **G**: Group tracks in this directory by album artist and album and import groups as albums. If the album artist for a track is not set then the artist is used to group that track.
- **E**: Enter an artist and album to use as a search in the database.
- **I**: Enter a metadata backend ID to use as search in the database.
- **B**: Cancel this import task altogether. No further albums will be tagged; beets shuts down immediately.
